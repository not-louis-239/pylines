# Overview

You have just started flying at Darculus Metropolis. This is a flight sandbox;
you are free to explore the region as you wish.

# Adjustments

The flaps have been pre-adjusted to be slightly down, optimal for takeoff.
Lowering the flaps increases lift and significantly increases drag, especially
at high deflections, hence the adjustment.

# Takeoff

To takeoff, apply full throttle and at 55 knots, raise the nose by 10-15°. Do
not raise the nose too high or you will stall. Wait until you reach a speed of
70 knots before attempting to climb more steeply.

# Cruise

As you fly, you can raise or lower the nose, or roll to adjust your direction.
You also have a map available for navigation guidance.

If you raise the nose too high, you will stall. To recover from a stall, pitch
down to regain speed until the stall warning stops.

For cruise, it is optimal to have the flaps fully up as it reduces both lift and
drag. However, it also increases stall speed and therefore the risk of stalling.

Additionally, be careful to manage your kinetic energy as overspeeding (letting
your speed exceed your plane's structural speed limit, as indicated by the red
region on your speedometer) may severely damage the airplane.

# Landing

To land, ensure you are inline with the target runway. The trick is to keep the
speed at 65 knots by controlling your pitch and throttle. Put the flaps fully
down to increase drag and reduce speed in preparation for landing.

Your glidescope will help you with landing by indicating your altitude relative
to the optimal glidepath. It is located to the bottom right of your artificial
horizon.
* The green needle indicates the correct glidepath. Keep it near the central line.
* If the green needle is above the central white line, you are too low-raise the nose slightly or add throttle.
* If the green needle is below the central white line, you are too high-drop the nose or reduce throttle.
Add more throttle if you get too low or less if you get too high. Slowly level
out at 10 feet above the runway, then drop to 5 feet and reduce throttle to none
before touching down gently, slightly nose-up.

# Prohibited Areas

Some areas are restricted for safety, military activity, or wildlife protection.
Flying into a prohibited area will trigger warnings and may affect your standing
as a pilot.
