# Overview

You have just started flying at Darculus Metropolis.

# Adjustments

The flaps have been pre-adjusted to be slightly down, optimal
for takeoff. Lowering the flaps increases lift and
significantly increases drag, especially at high
deflections, hence the pre-adjustment.

# Takeoff

To takeoff, apply full throttle and at 55 knots, raise
the nose by 10-15°. Do not raise the nose too high
or you will stall. Wait until you reach a speed of
70 knots before attempting to climb more steeply.

# Cruise

As you fly, you can raise or lower the nose, or roll to
adjust your direction. You also have a map available
for navigation guidance.

If you raise the nose too high, you will stall. To
recover from a stall, pitch down to regain speed until
the stall warning stops.

If you stall,
