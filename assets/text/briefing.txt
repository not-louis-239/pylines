You have been cleared for takeoff at Darculus Metropolis. Apply full power
and raise the nose at 55 knots. Do not raise the nose too high or you will stall.

Use the map to guide your navigation. When you are close to your selected GPS
destination, the glidescope will activate to provide landing assistance.

Happy flying!
