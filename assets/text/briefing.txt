You have been cleared for takeoff at Darculus Metropolis. Apply full power
and raise the nose at 55 knots. Do not raise the nose too high or you will stall.

While cruising, keep the flaps fully up to reduce drag, but be aware that this also
increases stall speed. Roll or use the rudder to turn if necessary. Use the map to
guide your navigation. If you stall, recover by pitching downward until the stall
warning stops.

When you are close to your selected GPS destination, the glidescope will activate to
provide landing assistance. Reduce throttle to avoid potentially overspeeding the
plane during descent. Lower the flaps and follow the glidepath for a smooth
landing.

Happy flying!
