# Pylines Flight Sim

## Overivew

This is a lightweight, open-source flight simulator made in Python with Pygame and a OpenGL. It uses a simplified flight model to allow users to learn about the mechanics of flight without being overwhelming.

**Author:** Louis Masarei-Boulton  
**Version:** 0.1

## Features

* Over 39,000 km² of land to fly over, with vast mountain ranges and rivers.
* A simplified Cessna 172 flight model and cockpit GUI.
* Different time of day settings (only in code right now)
* Landing feedback and (currently janky) crash mechanics.
* A stationary sun in the sky.
* Overspeed damage if you don't fly carefully.

## Project Status

**In Development**
* Core features and structure are under development and bound to change quickly.

## Planned Features

* Improved physics model to complement hilly terrain.
* Lore landmarks, e.g. buildings, runways.
* Aircraft customisation.
* Unit switching.
* Biomes
* Simple flight exercises.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Pygame
* PyOpenGL
